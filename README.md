# Various HLSL projects for Halo 3

Assuming you don't use other custom HLSL files, just put the fx files in the folder "H3EK/source/rasterizer/hlsl". If you do, please
modify both sets of files for compatibility.

As porting to newer games: It's likely compatible with Halo 3 ODST and maybe ElDewrito. Reach+, you will have to do extra work.
