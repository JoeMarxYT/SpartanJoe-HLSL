# Various HLSL projects for Halo 3

If you use other hlsl mods make sure to modify both this set and the other for compatibility. Either way drop the fx files in "...\H3EK\source\rasterizer\hlsl"

As porting to newer games: It's likely compatible with Halo 3 ODST and maybe ElDewrito. Reach+, you will have to do extra work.

There's also sample tags you can use you can use (thanks to RynoMods for porting the portable shield)
